### Introduction
A source code editor is an application that facilitates writing code. It is a text editor, but is specially made for editing source code of computer programs. This will be your fundamental programming tool when writing and editing code.

VSCode is only for writing the code. You will write the code, save it to your file system, and then run the code with a different application, such as Node.js.

### Installation
👉 VSCode’s site will detect our OS automatically. Visit https://code.visualstudio.com/ and download it by clicking on the button to download the application.

### 🚀 VSCode Packages
👉 This is one of the interesting things about VSCode. Many of its core features are actually just packages implemented the same way you would implement any other functionality.

👉 Packages that are bundled with VSCode are referred to as Core packages. Ones that aren’t bundled with VSCode are referred to as Community packages. You can download and install packages to add functionalities to your text editor or even develop your own packages.

👉 You can install and manage packages in the Settings view. There you will find your installed packages in the Packages tab.

### VSCode Linters
Let’s install some useful packages for practice.

👉 Linting is the process of running a program that analyses the code for potential errors.

👉 Linter programs automatically find basic mistakes and tell you where they are and how to fix them. It will make your code break less and prevent confusing problems.

👉 Lint was the name originally given to a particular program with a similar functionality in C language source code. Now, the term is applied widely to tools that flag potential errors in any computer language.

👉 In order to improve the functionality of our VSCode environment, let’s install the most useful linter programs.

👉 To install packages in VSCode, navigate to Extensions tab (Cmd⌘+Shift+X or Ctrl+Shift+X).

👉Search for ESLint and HTMLHint packages and click on Install button.
